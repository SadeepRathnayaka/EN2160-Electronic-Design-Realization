Semester 4 University Project - My Individual Work
Welcome to my semester 4 university project! This project is my solo effort, and I've designed it with some important features:

On/Off Switch: There's a main switch that turns the product on and off.
Multimeter and Power Supply: Another switch lets you switch between two modes: multimeter and 5V power supply.
Rotary Controls: Two rotary switches help you select modes and adjust the ohmmeter's scale.
LED Display: You can see all the important readings on an LED display.
Rechargeable Battery: What's really cool is that it has a rechargeable battery, so you don't have to keep replacing batteries. It even has a built-in charger.
