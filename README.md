# Semester 4 University Project - My Individual Work

**Introduction**

Welcome to my semester 4 university project! This project represents my individual work, and it comes with several important features:

- **On/Off Switch:** There's a main switch that turns the product on and off.
- **Multimeter and Power Supply Modes:** Another switch allows you to switch between two modes: multimeter and 5V power supply.
- **Rotary Controls:** You'll find two rotary switches designed for mode selection and adjusting the ohmmeter's scale.
- **LED Display:** All the important readings are conveniently displayed on an LED screen.
- **Rechargeable Battery:** What makes this product special is its built-in rechargeable battery system. Say goodbye to constant battery replacements; this product includes an integrated charger mechanism.
