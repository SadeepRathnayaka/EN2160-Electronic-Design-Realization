# Semester 4 University Project - My Individual Work

## Introduction


Welcome to my semester 4 university project! This project represents my individual work, and it comes with several important features:

- **On/Off Switch:** There's a main switch that turns the product on and off.
- **Multimeter and Power Supply Modes:** Another switch allows you to switch between two modes: multimeter and 5V power supply.
- **Rotary Controls:** You'll find two rotary switches designed for mode selection and adjusting the ohmmeter's scale.
- **LED Display:** All the important readings are conveniently displayed on an LED screen.
- **Rechargeable Battery:** What makes this product special is its built-in rechargeable battery system. Say goodbye to constant battery replacements; this product includes an integrated charger mechanism.

## Specifications

- This product functions primarily as a multimeter and can also serve as a 5V DC power supply.
- The multimeter offers four distinct modes:

    1. Voltmeter
       - Measurement range: 0V to 50V

    2. Ammeter
       - Measurement range: 1mA to 2A

    3. Ohmmeter
       - Measurement range: 0 ohms to 1M ohms
       - It includes four resistance scales:
           - 0 to 1K ohms
           - 1K to 100K ohms
           - 100K to 400K ohms
           - 400K to 1M ohms

    4. Continuity Checker

- No need to change probes when switching to ammeter mode.
- This product features a charging capability, and when fully charged, it can operate continuously for up to 12 hours.
- A two-way switch allows easy mode switching between multimeter and power supply.
- Weight: 500g
- Dimensions: 13cm × 9cm × 2.5cm
